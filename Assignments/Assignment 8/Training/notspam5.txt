You have received this email because you are classified as a senior by ODU. If you have already taken, and passed, the CS Exit Exam – please ignore this message and verify that degreeworks has been appropriately updated.

The Computer Science Exit Exam must be taken prior to the end of the semester in which you intend to graduate.  Each student must pass this exam by scoring above the lowest tenth percentile of the national average (see http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_computer_science.pdf). A lower score will require that you either remediate your lack of knowledge under the supervision of a faculty member, or you may retake the exam at your expense ($25).

It is recommended that you take the exam in your last semester at ODU to maximize your knowledge.  You may opt to take it earlier.

The exam is provided online and must be proctored.  It contains a brief survey, a tutorial of the tool, and two 60 minute exam sections.  So, plan on 2.5 hours of time.  Sample test questions are available (see http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/MFT/pdf/mft_samp_questions_compsci.pdf).

For students local to Hampton Roads, the exam will be proctored on campus in room 3104 in the E&CS Building on two dates during each semester. One will be in the morning, and one in the evening to accommodate work schedules.

·         The morning date is Thursday March 29, 2018 – 10:00 AM

·         The evening date is Thursday March 29, 2018 – 6:00 PM

If you are a Distance Learner who would need to travel from outside of Hampton Roads, we can pay a fee to ETS for online proctoring.  I will need to request this service in advance.  DL students must register for the exam by March 20, 2018 and complete the exam by April 5, 2018. You will receive an email from ETS inviting you to schedule the exam.

If you plan to take the exam this term, please reply with the following:

 

·         Name

·         The time you plan to come to campus – select one of the two provided

OR

·         Name

·         The city in which you live outside of Hampton Roads – and your wish to utilize online proctoring.

·
