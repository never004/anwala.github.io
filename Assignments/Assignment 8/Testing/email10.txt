Hello nate,
Rental Reminder

Your rental due date is Dec 16, 2017


Below are the rental title(s) that need to be returned by Dec 16, 2017. If you returned these items within the last 24 business hours, please disregard this message.

For your convenience, you can print a free return shipping label and packing slip. Write your return address on the shipping label. Shipping instructions are included on the packing slip. To avoid late fees, your shipment must be submitted at a location which accepts FedEx GROUND packages before or on your rental due date. Dropping your GROUND shipment in an express box will cause delays and assessment of late fees.

Thank you.
