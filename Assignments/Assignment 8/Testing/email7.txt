You're about to graduate, your future will forever be defined by your efforts to complete this degree. Who knows what will come next, where you will live, where you will work.


One thing you can be certain of - every single late night, every barely reached deadline, every hour studying was worth it. Don't panic, you have a transition ahead of you, you haven't found a job yet? It'll work out. Haven't decided which grad school to attend? Soon enough you will.


But what is certain, is your degree is coming.

UNCERTAIN futures can't keep you down. Oh no, not an accomplished almost-graduate like yourself. You've got to celebrate with errr-body. Get some invites, tell people you're ready to party.

or Old School?

It's what Grandma knows. It's what she loves. Also, it's super hip to send these things, need we mention the Hipster Beard Movement?
