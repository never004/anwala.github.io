Hello, Nathaniel!

I'm sorry to have to do this to you, but I've actually dropped the course. My previous partner for the SQL assignment dropped and I was left without a partner for PL/SQL. Hopefully, I'm letting you know soon enough that you have enough time to find someone else for a partnership.

Lots of luck!
