Mr Everett,

Glad you asked.

The default value of the php directive 'short_open_tag' is supposed to be '1'.  This allows you to use '<?' instead of '<?php'.  This appears to be the case on the web servers but not on other hosts, at least atria.  I will contact root about this but in the meantime you can use

php -ld 'short_open_tag'='1'

instead of

php -l
